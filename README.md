# JavaScript Jump 'n' Run Game

This project is a simple 2D platformer game inspired by the classic Super Mario Bros. game. The game is developed using JavaScript and runs in the browser.

## Game Mechanics

The player controls a character who can move left or right and perform double jumps. The game world consists of a series of obstacles that the player must avoid. The obstacles are generated dynamically and their placement is calculated to ensure that the player can always jump over them.
